# Algorithms analysis contd.

The absolute running time of an algorithms cannot be predicted, since it depends on a number of factors.

- Programming language used to implement the algorithm.
- The computer the program runs on.
- Other programs running at the same time.
- Quality of the operating system.

> We evaluate the performance of an algorithm **_in terms of its input size_**. \
> \
> **_Time complexity_** -> Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.\
> **_Space complexity_** -> Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.\
> **=> By evaluating against the input size, the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparison is also more appropriate.**

## How to represent complexity?

Asymptotic notations:

- Big O Notation (O - Notation) -> Worst case complexity
- Omega Notation (_0_ Notation) -> Best case complexity
- Theta Notation (0 Notation) -> Average case complexity
