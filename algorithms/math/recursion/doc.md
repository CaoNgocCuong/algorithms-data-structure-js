# Recursion

## What?

Recursion is a problem resolving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
Recursion is when a function calls itself.

## Why?

A great technique to simplify your solution.
If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem, recursion is very useful.

## A few points about recursion

Every recursion solution needs to have a base case - **a condition to terminate the recursion**.
Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution.\
A recursion solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution.\
Recursion is a topic that is not the most straight forward to understand. _Do not give up if you struggle with the concept._

# Tips for recursive solutions

1. Figure out how to break down the problem into smaller versions of the same problem.
2. Identify the base case for recursion
